Hi this is just a rough suggestion to get you started with the drone, from some code I found on the internet.
To get the robot to fly around, you can try the code in Single_Tell_Test.
To access the camera, you can try to run testVideo1.py, then testVideo2.py (this worked for me on various computers; it also seemed to work integrated with ROS code...).
Good luck!
